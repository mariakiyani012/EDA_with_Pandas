# **Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas**

## **Overview**
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on two datasets: Pakistan Population dataset and Titanic dataset. The goal is to understand the data, clean it, visualize patterns, and perform feature engineering.

## **Contents**

1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**
    - Load datasets and perform initial exploration.
    - Check data structure and basic statistics.

2. **Data Cleaning**
    - Handle missing values.
    - Ensure data quality and consistency.

3. **Descriptive Statistics and Insights**
    - Calculate basic statistics.
    - Explore specific areas and subgroups.

4. **Data Visualization**
    - Create visualizations to understand patterns and relationships.
    - Visualize missing values, correlation matrices, and pair plots.

5. **Binning and Feature Engineering**
    - Perform binning to convert continuous variables into categorical ones.
    - Create new features for enhanced analysis.

6. **Data Grouping and Aggregation**
    - Group data by various columns to compute aggregate statistics.
    - Explore survival rates and fare differences based on categories.

7. **Data Filtering**
    - Apply filtering techniques to isolate specific rows based on conditions.
    - Combine multiple filters for targeted data selection.

## **Datasets**

1. **Pakistan Population Dataset**
   - Downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mabdullahsajid/population-of-pakistan-dataset).
   - Contains population data of Pakistan's subdivisions.

2. **Titanic Dataset**
   - Loaded from Seaborn library.
   - Contains information about Titanic passengers.

## **Files**

- `EDA_with_Pandas.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code.
- `subdivision_population_data.xlsx`: Excel file created from the Pakistan Population CSV dataset.
- `README.md`: This file.


## **Key Learnings**

- **Data Understanding:** Gained insights into the structure and content of the datasets.
- **Data Cleaning:** Learned to handle missing values and ensure data consistency.
- **Visualization:** Improved skills in creating and interpreting visualizations.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features and converted continuous data into categorical bins.
- **Grouping and Filtering:** Summarized and filtered data effectively.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the steps involved in conducting effective EDA, preparing data for analysis or modeling, and deriving valuable insights from raw datasets. It highlights the importance of data quality and informed decision-making in data-driven projects.
